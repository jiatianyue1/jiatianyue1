Yeast cells were first pre-cultured with shaking (180rpm) overnight at 28°C  in 50ml flasks containing YNB medium. After centrifugation, pellets were washed with synthetic must. These pre-cultures were used to inoculate fermentations (10^6 cells/ml) in synthetic must. Fermentation experiments were performed at 24°C in fermenters with a working volume of 1.1l. The synthtetic must used contains 230g/l of sugars ( (115g/L glucose and 115g/l of fructose), and either 71 or 425 mg/L of yeast assimilable nitrogen (free amino acids and ammonium).	total RNA	Total RNA extraction were performed with Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies), purified by isopropanol precipitation then using RNeasy kit (Qiagen).

Yeast cells were first pre-cultured with shaking (180rpm) overnight at 28°C  in 50ml flasks containing YNB medium. After centrifugation, pellets were washed with synthetic must. These pre-cultures were used to inoculate fermentations (10^6 cells/ml) in synthetic must. Fermentation experiments were performed at 24°C in fermenters with a working volume of 1.1l. The synthtetic must used contains 230g/l of sugars ( (115g/L glucose and 115g/l of fructose), and either 71 or 425 mg/L of yeast assimilable nitrogen (free amino acids and ammonium).	total RNA	Total RNA extraction were performed with Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies), purified by isopropanol precipitation then using RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Cy3	Cy3-labeled cRNA was synthesized with the One color RNA Spike-In kit (Agilent Technologies) and purified with RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Quality and quantity of RNA were controlled at each step by spectrometry (NanoDrop 1000, Thermo Scientific).	4932	Agilent gene expression microarrays 8x15k was used for the micro array hybridization, with one-color method. Array design is based on ID 038619 completed with the regions A, B and C + KHR1 + MPR1 from the new regions of EC1118  (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 600ng of labeled cRNA were hybridized for 17h in 65°C in a rotative hybridization oven (Corning) using the Expression Hybridization kit (Agilent Technologies, 5188-5242). Plates were washed with expression wash buffer kit (Agilent Technologies, 5188-5325 5188-5326).	The array pictures were analyzed on a GenePix 4000B laser Scanner (Axon Instruments) and with the GenePix software Pro7.
